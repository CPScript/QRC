# Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic System (QRCs)

QRCs is an experimental post-quantum cryptographic framework implementing hybrid lattice-based encryption with hash-based digital signatures. The system combines Ring Learning With Errors, standard Learning With Errors, and Merkle signature schemes to provide defense against both classical and quantum cryptanalytic attacks.

## Architecture

The system implements a multi-layer cryptographic approach using:

Ring-LWE encryption for structured lattice problems
Standard LWE encryption for unstructured lattice security  
Hash-based signatures using Merkle trees and Winternitz one-time signatures
Advanced Reed-Solomon error correction with Berlekamp-Massey decoding
Constant-time operations for side-channel resistance
Military-grade entropy collection from multiple hardware sources
Key switching and bootstrapping for homomorphic operations
Authenticated encryption with HMAC-SHA3-512

## Security Levels

CLASSICAL_128 - 128-bit classical security equivalent
CLASSICAL_192 - 192-bit classical security equivalent
CLASSICAL_256 - 256-bit classical security equivalent
QUANTUM_128 - 128-bit post-quantum security
QUANTUM_192 - 192-bit post-quantum security  
QUANTUM_256 - 256-bit post-quantum security
FORTRESS - Maximum security configuration

## Installation

Python 3.8 or higher required with numpy dependency.

```
pip install numpy
```

No additional dependencies required. System uses only Python standard library and numpy.

## Basic Usage

```python
from QRCs import QRCs, SecurityLevel

# Initialize system
system = QRCs(SecurityLevel.QUANTUM_256)

# Generate keypair
public_key, private_key = system.generate_keypair()

# Encrypt data
plaintext = b"confidential message"
associated_data = b"authentication context"
ciphertext = system.encrypt(plaintext, public_key, associated_data)

# Decrypt data
decrypted = system.decrypt(ciphertext, private_key, associated_data)

# Digital signatures
signature = system.sign(plaintext, private_key)
is_valid = system.verify(plaintext, signature, public_key)
```

## Technical Specifications

## Performance Characteristics

Key generation: 50-500ms depending on security level

Performance scales with security level. FORTRESS configuration provides maximum security at cost of reduced performance.

## Implementation Details

All arithmetic operations use constant-time implementations to prevent timing attacks. Random number generation combines multiple entropy sources including hardware performance counters, system entropy pools, and cryptographic random generators.

Error correction uses advanced Reed-Solomon codes with polynomial-time Berlekamp-Massey algorithm for optimal error locator computation. The system can correct up to t errors per codeword where t is configurable.

Key switching enables homomorphic operations while maintaining security properties. Bootstrapping allows noise reduction in ciphertext without exposing secret information.

## Cryptographic Primitives

Ring-LWE problem hardness based on shortest vector problem in ideal lattices
Standard LWE problem hardness based on shortest vector problem in general lattices
Hash-based signatures provide information-theoretic security
Number theoretic transforms enable efficient polynomial arithmetic
Discrete Gaussian sampling for lattice noise generation
Modular arithmetic with precomputed primitive roots

## Research Applications

This implementation is suitable for:

Post-quantum cryptography research
Lattice-based cryptanalysis studies
Hybrid cryptographic system analysis
Performance benchmarking of post-quantum algorithms
Educational purposes in advanced cryptography

## Limitations

The system has not undergone formal security analysis or peer review. Parameter selection is based on current research but may require adjustment as cryptanalytic techniques advance.

Signature keys support limited number of signatures before requiring regeneration. Performance decreases significantly at maximum security levels.

Implementation focuses on correctness and research utility rather than production optimization. Side-channel protections may be incomplete against sophisticated physical attacks.
